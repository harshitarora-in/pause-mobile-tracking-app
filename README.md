or employee to get more focused on their work in the “ New Normal ” environment.

<br>
**PROBLEM SOLVED**
<br>
The simple fact is that work from the home experiment has been a huge success. But "the
new normal " environment has become a hot topic for many organizations and how will this
affect productivity and employee’s well being , so pause is a solution for that .
With pause you can now track how much time you spent on your phone, you can also track
time spent on each app, what's more, pause also lets you earn rewards and if that wasn't
enough, this app will also tell you how addicted you are to your phone as we want you to be
productive and adapt easily to "The New Normal" environment .
<br>
**FUNCTIONING**
<br>
The core functioning of this app is based on “tracking”. It helps you manage the time you
spend on your smartphone and fight phone addiction.
It seems counterintuitive to use an app to unplug, but in an age where we use our phones for
everything- it makes sense to fight fire with fire and this app actually works.
The user needs to first add funds and if the user sticks to his/ her daily limit he will be
rewarded . He can claim a bonus. Basically reward is nothing but the user's own money
which he/ she will get as a reward for using their phone in the defined limit. And lastly we
have a profile dashboard for every user to see his/her daily and weekly usage and number
of points he /she has earned. If promoted, it will be very useful for people in the “New Normal
“ environment .
It can be used by companies so that employees can focus on their work, companies will add
funds in the employee's account and they can get incentives
Not only companies, It can be used by parents to make their children be more focused
towards study and they can fund children's pocket money in it.
